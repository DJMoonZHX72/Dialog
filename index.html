[Three old friends meet at a coffee shop after years apart.]<br><br>

R: No way! Mike? Jack? I thought Iâ€™d never see you guys again!<br><br>

M: Ryan! Bro, itâ€™s been forever! You havenâ€™t changed a bit!<br><br>

J: Haha, speak for yourself, Mike! You got old, man!<br><br>

M: Hey, at least I still have my hair! Unlike someone I knowâ€¦ *looks at Jack*<br><br>

J: Oh, shut up! Itâ€™s called "mature elegance." Anyway, how have you guys been?<br><br>

R: Not bad! I run my own business now. What about you guys?<br><br>

M: Thatâ€™s awesome, man! Iâ€™m working as a software developer. You know, sitting in front of a screen all day.<br><br>

J: And Iâ€™m in construction. Hard work, but it keeps me in shape!<br><br>

R: Wow, weâ€™ve all changed so much. Do you guys ever think about the old days?<br><br>

M: All the time! Remember when we used to sneak out at night to play soccer in the schoolyard?<br><br>

J: Oh yeah! Until that one time the security guard caught us, and we had to run like crazy!<br><br>

R: Hahaha! And Mike tripped over a trash can!<br><br>

M: Hey, that was slippery, okay?! Besides, Jack was the one who screamed like a little kid!<br><br>

J: That was NOT a scream, it wasâ€¦ a battle cry.<br><br>

R: Sure, bro, whatever helps you sleep at night.<br><br>

M: And do you guys remember our camping trip?<br><br>

J: Oh, you mean the one where Ryan got lost for three hours because he thought he "knew a shortcut"?<br><br>

R: Okay, okay, I admit that was a bad call. But hey, we survived, right?<br><br>

M: Barely! If we had listened to you, weâ€™d still be lost in that forest!<br><br>

J: Man, those were the best times. No responsibilities, no stress, just us being idiots.<br><br>

R: True. But hey, life moves on. At least weâ€™re here now.<br><br>

M: Yeah, we should do this more often. Letâ€™s not wait another ten years!<br><br>

J: Agreed. But first, letâ€™s grab some burgers. Talking about the past makes me hungry.<br><br>

R: Now thatâ€™s the Jack I remember! Letâ€™s go!  ðŸ”¥</p>
